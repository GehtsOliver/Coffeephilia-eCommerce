### Description
This eCommerce website was primarily created using NextJS on the Frontend combined with the Shopify Storefront API as backend. The website does not only offer a product/ firm landing page but also provides an eCommerce Store which was build on top of Shopify's Storefront API. After my personal website, this is my second project built with NextJS. You can see how fast the website is due to Next's static site generation (SSG). Every page is pre-built by NextJS. Shopify's Buy SDK was used to connect the store page to Shopify's backend which offers a secure way to fetch the products and handle payment.

### Libraries/Packages Used
+ React-Scroll-Parallax: Parallax scroll effect package
